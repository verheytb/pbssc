# pbssc
Generates single-stranded CCS reads from PacBio .bax.h5 files of amplicon sequences aligned to a reference.

## Introduction
PacBio's SMRT

## Dependencies

`pbssc.py` is compatible with python 2.7, and requires the following modules:
- [ConsensusCore](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ConsensusCore)
- [GenomicConsensus](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus)
- [pbcore](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbcore)

## Instructions
1. Use the Resequencing SMRT Analysis method to align subreads to the reference sequence. Since the reads must align to the reference, pbssc only generates single-stranded reads for variants of a known sequence, such as in 
2. 

Run `pbssc.py` 

```sh


```
